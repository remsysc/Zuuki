        🐾 Welcome to Zuuki! We're improving our animal inventory system by replacing fixed-size parallel arrays with dynamic `ArrayList`s. This helps make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

        - Replace `String[] name = new String[kSize];` with `ArrayList<String> name = new ArrayList<>();`
        - Do the same for `age`, `species`, and `enclosure_number`
        - Remove `kSize` and use `.add()` to insert data
        - Update any logic that uses indexing to use `.get(index)` instead

        - You don’t need to change the entire app—just the array declarations and related logic
        - Make sure to test the output after refactoring
        - Ask in the comments if you're unsure how to use `ArrayList`

        🧪 Want a challenge later? Try creating an `Animal` class and refactor the system to use `ArrayList<Animal>` instead. But for now, let’s keep it simple and clean.

        Thanks for contributing to Zuuki! 💙
